##Predicting whether e-commerce customers use coupons##

In this project, I will be exploring the impact of coupons on consumer purchasing behavior using a dataset provided by Kaggle.https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishikumarrajvansh/marketing-insights-for-e-commerce-company/data?select=Online_Sales.csv. This dataset includes marketing insights for an e-commerce company, particularly focusing on online sales data. The reason for choosing this dataset is that numerous studies have proven that coupons effectively promote purchases. Therefore, I will conduct preliminary exploratory analyses, with a focus on how coupons influence consumer buying behavior. My analysis will be based on the data structure provided in the dataset, using various statistical methods and data visualization techniques to reveal the relationship between coupons and sales. These analyses will help us better understand the impact of coupons on e-commerce sales and may provide valuable insights for formulating e-commerce marketing strategies.

##Tool##
Talend Data Integration
Merging different datasets and making the structure cleaner and clearer.

KNIME (as a replacement for Talend Data Prep)
Since the free version of Talend Data Prep is limited to processing only 30,000 records, KNIME is used for transforming and processing datasets. It involves checking for null values and converting some data types to facilitate better modeling, turning coupons into a binary classification of 0 and 2.

SAS e-Miner
Exploring relationships to determine the connections between different values and to evaluate the effectiveness of models.
