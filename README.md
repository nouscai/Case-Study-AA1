# Case Study: Predicting E-commerce Coupon Use (Case-Study-AA1)

## Overview

This project aims to examine the influence of coupons on consumer purchasing behavior within the e-commerce sector. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, specifically designed for marketing insights in e-commerce [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishikumarrajvansh/marketing-insights-for-e-commerce-company/data?select=Online_Sales.csv), the study will delve into various aspects of online sales data. The selection of this dataset is anchored on the premise that coupons are a proven tool for stimulating consumer purchases.

## Objectives

The primary objective is to conduct an in-depth exploratory analysis with a special focus on the role of coupons in shaping consumer buying patterns. The study will leverage the rich data structure provided in the dataset, employing a range of statistical methods and data visualization techniques. This approach aims to elucidate the intricate relationship between coupon usage and sales figures.

## Methodology

1. **Data Integration (Tool: Talend Data Integration):** This phase involves merging different datasets to enhance the clarity and cleanliness of the data structure. It's crucial for establishing a solid foundation for subsequent analyses.

2. **Data Transformation and Processing (Tool: KNIME):** Given the limitation of Talend Data Prep's free version (max 30,000 records), KNIME steps in as an alternative for data transformation and processing. This step includes checking for null values and converting data types to improve modeling efficiency. Specifically, it entails transforming the representation of coupons into a binary classification (0 and 1).

3. **Data Analysis and Model Evaluation (Tool: SAS e-Miner):** In this stage, the focus shifts to exploring relationships within the dataset. This includes identifying connections between various variables and assessing the effectiveness of predictive models.

## Expected Outcomes

The analyses conducted in this project are anticipated to provide a deeper understanding of the impact of coupons on e-commerce sales. The insights gained could be instrumental in shaping effective e-commerce marketing strategies, especially in the context of enhancing sales through targeted coupon distribution.
